# Writing Effective Skills

## The Description Field

According to Anthropic's engineering blog: "This metadata...provides just enough information for Claude to know when each skill should be used without loading all of it into context." This is the first level of progressive disclosure.

**Structure:** `[What it does]` + `[When to use it]` + `[Key capabilities]`

### Good Descriptions

```yaml
# Good - specific and actionable
description: Analyzes Figma design files and generates developer handoff
  documentation. Use when user uploads .fig files, asks for "design specs",
  "component documentation", or "design-to-code handoff".

# Good - includes trigger phrases
description: Manages Linear project workflows including sprint planning, task
  creation, and status tracking. Use when user mentions "sprint", "Linear tasks",
  "project planning", or asks to "create tickets".

# Good - clear value proposition
description: End-to-end customer onboarding workflow for PayFlow. Handles account
  creation, payment setup, and subscription management. Use when user says
  "onboard new customer", "set up subscription", or "create PayFlow account".
```

### Bad Descriptions

```yaml
# Too vague
description: Helps with projects.

# Missing triggers
description: Creates sophisticated multi-page documentation systems.

# Too technical, no user triggers
description: Implements the Project entity model with hierarchical relationships.
```

## Writing the Main Instructions

After the frontmatter, write the actual instructions in Markdown.

### Recommended Structure

Adapt this template for your skill. Replace bracketed sections with your specific content.

```markdown
---
name: your-skill
description: [...]
---

# Your Skill Name

## Instructions

### Step 1: [First Major Step]
Clear explanation of what happens.

```bash
python scripts/fetch_data.py --project-id PROJECT_ID
```

Expected output: [describe what success looks like]

(Add more steps as needed)

## Examples

### Example 1: [common scenario]

User says: "Set up a new marketing campaign"

Actions:
1. Fetch existing campaigns via MCP
2. Create new campaign with provided parameters

Result: Campaign created with confirmation link

(Add more examples as needed)

## Troubleshooting

**Error:** [Common error message]
**Cause:** [Why it happens]
**Solution:** [How to fix]

(Add more error cases as needed)
```

## Best Practices for Instructions

### Be Specific and Actionable

✅ **Good:**
```text
Run `python scripts/validate.py --input {filename}` to check data format.
If validation fails, common issues include:
- Missing required fields (add them to the CSV)
- Invalid date formats (use YYYY-MM-DD)
```

❌ **Bad:**
```text
Validate the data before proceeding.
```

### Reference Bundled Resources Clearly

```text
Before writing queries, consult `references/api-patterns.md` for:
- Rate limiting guidance
- Pagination patterns
- Error codes and handling
```

### Use Progressive Disclosure

Keep `SKILL.md` focused on core instructions. Move detailed documentation to `references/` and link to it. (See Core Design Principles for how the three-level system works.)

### Include Error Handling

```markdown
## Common Issues

### MCP Connection Failed

If you see "Connection refused":
1. Verify MCP server is running: Check Settings > Extensions
2. Confirm API key is valid
3. Try reconnecting: Settings > Extensions > [Your Service] > Reconnect
```
