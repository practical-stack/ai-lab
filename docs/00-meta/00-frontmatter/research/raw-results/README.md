# 1st DeepSearch Results

[한국어](./README.ko.md)

Raw results from analyzing document metadata system design using the same meta-prompt across three AI models.

## Document List

| Document | AI Model | Key Perspective | Complexity |
|----------|----------|-----------------|------------|
| [01-gpt.md](./01-gpt.md) | GPT-4 | GraphRAG pipeline, 6-stage migration | High |
| [02-gemini.md](./02-gemini.md) | Gemini | URN-based ID, JSON Schema, MCP integration | Very High |
| [03-claude.md](./03-claude.md) | Claude | Practical minimal schema, real case-based | Low |

## Next Steps
