# Agent: Designer (Designer-Turned-Developer)

**Model:** Sonnet (MEDIUM)
**File:** `agents/designer.md` (95 lines)
**Tool Restrictions:** Standard implementation tools

## Identity

"You are a designer who learned to code. You see what pure developers miss — spacing, color harmony, micro-interactions, the flow of an interface."

The designer combines aesthetic sensibility with implementation capability. It must commit to a bold aesthetic direction before writing any code.

## Aesthetic Direction Process

1. Detect frontend framework (React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, Solid, Vanilla)
2. Choose BOLD aesthetic direction with: Purpose → Tone → Constraints → Differentiation
3. Select from extreme tones: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined
4. Pair fonts: characterful display + refined body

## Anti-Patterns (NEVER)

- Generic fonts (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Purple gradients on white ("AI slop")
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design lacking context-specific character
- Converging on common choices across generations

## Motion Philosophy

"One well-orchestrated page load > scattered micro-interactions"

## Patterns Demonstrated

- **Anti-AI-Slop** — explicit aesthetic anti-patterns
- **Persona anchoring** — designer-who-codes identity
- **Framework detection** — adapt to project technology
